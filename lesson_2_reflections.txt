What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Nothing happens lmao... You need to initialize a repository in order for it to exist. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area encourages you to focus on certain documents over everything at once and allows for better organization.
