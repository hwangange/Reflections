What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Nothing happens lmao... You need to initialize a repository in order for it to exist. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area encourages you to focus on certain documents over everything at once and allows for better organization. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

staging area gives you a preview of what you are about to commit. You can use 'git diff' to see the changes made between the staging area and working directory to verify that you have one commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you want to...
Create different versions of your project
Test a new feature.
Branches allow you to easily revert back to the original version if your new version does not work out nicely.
