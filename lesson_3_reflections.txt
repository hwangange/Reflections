When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're working with others or on multiple computing systems.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic updates may involve syncing unwanted/useless code or unimportant changes. How inefficient is that?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches: A collection of commits grouped together
Clones: Copy of repository either from GitHub to local server or from local server to local server
Forks: Copy of repository from GitHub to GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Having everything synced and less confusion
